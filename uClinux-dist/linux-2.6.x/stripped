Description : This file contains the Linux kernel options I enabled/disabled
              on 8/27/12 in order to shrink our kernel to fit within 1.25MB
              (when compressed). Use in case something you expect to work is
              no longer working. Feel free to delete if you feel that this
              file is no longer needed.
